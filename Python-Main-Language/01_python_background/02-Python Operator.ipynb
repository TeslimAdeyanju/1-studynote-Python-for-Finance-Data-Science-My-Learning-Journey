    "### **Arithmetic operator**\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operators are the most commonly used. The Python programming language provides arithmetic operators that perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It works the same as basic mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are seven arithmetic operators we can use to perform different mathematical operations, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `+` (Addition)\n",
    "2. `-` (Subtraction)\n",
    "3. `*` (Multiplication)\n",
    "4. `/` (Division)\n",
    "5. `//` Floor division)\n",
    "6. `℅` (Modulus)\n",
    "7. `*` (Exponentiation)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Addition operator `+`**\n",
    "\n",
    "It adds two or more operands and gives their sum as a result. It works the same as a unary plus. In simple terms,  It performs the addition of two or more than two values and gives their sum as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 40\n",
    "print(x + y)\n",
    "\n",
    "# output\n",
    "50\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we can use the addition operator with strings, and it will become string concatenation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Kelly\"\n",
    "surname = \"Ault\"\n",
    "print(surname + \" \" + name)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output Ault Kelly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subtraction `-`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use to subtracts the second value from the first value and gives the difference between them. It works the same as a unary minus. The subtraction operator is denoted by `-` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiplication `*`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiply two operands. In simple terms, it is used to multiplies two or more values and gives their product as a result. The multiplication operator is denoted by a `*` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 2\n",
    "y = 4\n",
    "z = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x * y)\n",
    "# Output 8 (2*4)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x * y * z)\n",
    "# Output 40 (2*4*5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the multiplication operator with string. When used with string, it works as a repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Jessa\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(name * 3)\n",
    "# Output JessaJessaJessa\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Division `/`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide the left operand (dividend) by the right one (divisor) and provide the result (quotient ) in a float value. The division operator is denoted by a `/` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 2\n",
    "y = 4\n",
    "z = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "print(y / x)\n",
    "# Output 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "print(z / y / x)\n",
    "# Output 1.0\n",
    "# print(z / 0)  # error\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Floor `//`\n",
    "\n",
    "Floor division in Python is a mathematical operation that divides two numbers and returns the quotient as an integer, *rounded down to the nearest whole number.* It is performed using the double forward slash (//) operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Floor Division Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- It divides the first number (dividend) by the second number (divisor) and returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to the result.\n",
    "- If the result of regular division is already an integer, floor division returns the same value.\n",
    "- If the result of regular division is a floating-point number, floor division rounds down the result to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Positive Integers**\n",
    "    - `5 // 2` returns `2` (5 divided by 2 is 2.5, which is rounded down to 2).\n",
    "    - `10 // 3` returns `3` (10 divided by 3 is 3.33..., which is rounded down to 3)\n",
    "2. **Negative Integers**\n",
    "    - `17 // 5` returns `4` (-17 divided by 5 is -3.4, which is rounded down to -4).\n",
    "    - `10 // 4` returns `3` (-10 divided by 4 is -2.5, which is rounded down to -3)\n",
    "3. **Floats and Integers**\n",
    "    - `7.5 // 2` returns `3.0` (7.5 divided by 2 is 3.75, which is rounded down to 3.0).[4]\n",
    "    - `13.4 // 3` returns `4.0` (13.4 divided by 3 is 4.46..., which is rounded down to 4.0).[3]\n",
    "4. **Negative Floats and Integers**\n",
    "    - `17.5 // 3` returns `6.0` (-17.5 divided by 3 is -5.83..., which is rounded down to -6.0).[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- Floor division always rounds down the result to the nearest integer, regardless of the sign of the operands.\n",
    "- It can be used with integers, floats, or a combination of both.\n",
    "- Dividing by zero raises a `ZeroDivisionError.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Floor division is a useful operation when you need to work with whole numbers or when you want to intentionally discard the fractional part of a division result.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modulus `%`\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of the division of left operand by the right. The modulus operator is denoted by a `%` symbol. In simple terms, the Modulus operator divides one value by a second and gives the remainder as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 15\n",
    "y = 4\n",
    "\n",

    "# output 3\n",

    "**7. Exponent `*`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using exponent operator left operand raised to the power of right. The exponentiation operator is denoted by a double asterisk ** symbol. You can use it as a shortcut to calculate the exponential value. For example, `2**3` Here 2 is multiplied by itself 3 times, i.e., `2*2*2`. Here the 2 is the base, and 3 is an exponent.\n",
    "\n",
