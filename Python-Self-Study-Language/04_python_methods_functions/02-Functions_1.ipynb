    "* Formally, a `function` is a useful device that groups together a set of statements so they can be run more than once. They can also let us specify parameters that can serve as inputs to the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Functions allow us to not have to repeatedly write the same code again and again\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why even use functions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, you should use functions when you plan on using a block of code multiple times. The function will allow you to call the same block of code without having to write it multiple times. This in turn will allow us to create more complex Python scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "function in Python have several features that make them powerful and versatile. Here are some of the key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modularity: Functions allow you to break down your code into smaller, manageable pieces. This promotes code reusability and makes your code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "   \n",
    "1. Code Reusability: Once defined, functions can be called multiple times from different parts of your program, reducing redundancy and promoting cleaner code. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parameter Passing: Functions can accept parameters (also called arguments), which are values passed to the function when it is called. These parameters can be used within the function's body.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Return Values: Functions can return values using the return statement. This allows functions to compute a result and pass it back to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scope: Variables defined within a function have local scope, meaning they only exist within the function. This helps prevent naming conflicts and promotes encapsulation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "1. Global Variables: Functions can access variables defined in the global scope, but they cannot modify them by default unless explicitly stated using the global keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions): Python supports the creation of anonymous functions using the lambda keyword. These functions are defined inline and are often used for short, one-time operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First-Class Citizens: In Python, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nested Functions: Python allows you to define functions inside other functions. These nested functions have access to variables from the outer (enclosing) scope, which can be useful for encapsulation and reducing namespace pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decorators: Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods. They provide a clean and concise way to add functionality to existing functions without modifying their code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Documentation Strings (Docstring): Functions can have documentation strings, also known as docstring, which are string literals used to describe the purpose and usage of the function. Docstring can be accessed via the __doc__ attribute of the function object.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make functions a fundamental building block of Python programming, enabling developers to write modular, reusable, and maintainable code."

    "The active selection is a Python script that includes a function definition and a function call. The function, named `stock_selection`, takes a list of tuples `stock_market` as an argument. Each tuple in the list represents a stock and its corresponding price.\n",

    "At the start of the function, two variables are initialized: `selected_stock_price` is set to 0 and `selected_stock_name` is set to a single space. These variables are used to keep track of the stock with the highest price.\n",

    "The function then iterates over the `stock_market` list. For each tuple, it checks if the price (`price`) is greater than the current highest price (`selected_stock_price`). If it is, `selected_stock_price` is updated to this higher price, and `selected_stock_name` is updated to the name of this stock (`stock`).\n",
