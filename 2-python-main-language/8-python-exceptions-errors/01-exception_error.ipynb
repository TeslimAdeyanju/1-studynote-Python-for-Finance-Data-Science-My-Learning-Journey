    "Exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. When an exception occurs, the program stops executing and Python raises an exception. If the exception is not handled properly, the program will crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception is a Python object that represents an error..In Python, an exception is an object derives from the BaseException class that contains information about an error event that occurred within a method. Exception object contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Error type (exception name)\n",
    "* The state of the program when the error occurred\n",
    "* An error message describes the error event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception are useful to indicate different types of possible failure condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, bellow are the few standard exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FileNotFoundException\n",
    "1. ImportError\n",
    "1. RuntimeError\n",
    "1. NameError\n",

    "> In Python, we can throw an exception in the try block and catch it in except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use Exception\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standardized error handling: Using built-in exceptions or creating a custom exception with a more precise name and description, you can adequately define the error event, which helps you debug the error event.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cleaner code: Exceptions separate the error-handling code from regular code, which helps us to maintain large code easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Robust application: With the help of exceptions, we can develop a solid application, which can handle error event efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Exceptions propagation: By default, the exception propagates the call stack if you donâ€™t catch it. For example, if any error event occurred in a nested function, you do not have to explicitly catch-and-forward it; automatically, it gets forwarded to the calling function where you can handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Different error types: Either you can use built-in exception or create your custom exception and group them by their generalized parent class, or Differentiate errors by their actual class"

    "Errors are problems in a program that typically occur because of mistakes in the code. They can prevent the program from running at all.Usuallly, errors are caused by syntax errors, type errors, or runtime errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The errors can be broadly classified into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Syntax errors\n",
    "1. Logical errors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.0 Syntax errors** \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax error occurs when we are not following the proper structure or syntax of the language. A syntax error is also known as a parsing error. \n",
    "\n",
    "A parsing error in Python generally refers to a SyntaxError that occurs when the Python interpreter is unable to understand the source code. This happens when the code doesn't follow the correct syntax rules of the Python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python parses the program and finds an incorrect statement it is known as a syntax error. When the parser found a syntax error it exits with an error message without running anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Python Syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Missing colon\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x > 10\n",

    "print(\"Hello World\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: Missing closing parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Missing indentation:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.0 Logical errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical errors occur when the program runs without any error but it does not produce the expected output. Logical errors are also known as bugs. Logical errors are the most difficult to find and fix because they are not detected by the compiler or interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Python Logical errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Incorrect output:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    return x - y\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add(10, 5)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Error: The function should return the sum of x and y, but it returns the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Infinite loop:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1\n",
    "while x > 0:\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: The loop will run infinitely because the condition is always true.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling Parsing Errors**  \n",
    "Parsing errors must be fixed in the source code because they prevent the program from being interpreted or compiled. The Python interpreter typically points out the location of the error and provides a message indicating what went wrong, which helps in diagnosing and fixing the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points  \n",
    "1. Parsing errors in Python are called SyntaxError.\n",
    "1. They occur when the code does not conform to Python's syntax rules.\n",
    "1. Common causes include missing colons, unmatched parentheses, incorrect indentation, misplaced keywords, and improper string quotes.\n",
    "1. The Python interpreter provides error messages to help locate and fix these errors.\n",
    "Understanding and correcting parsing errors is crucial for writing syntactically correct Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling Logical Errors**  \n",
    "Logical errors are more challenging to identify and fix because they do not cause the program to crash or produce error messages. Instead, they result in incorrect output or behavior that may not be immediately apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points  \n",
    "1. Logical errors occur when the program runs without crashing but produces incorrect results.\n",
    "1. They are caused by mistakes in the program's logic or algorithm.\n",
    "1. Common examples include incorrect calculations, wrong conditional statements, and infinite loops.\n",
    "1. Debugging logical errors requires careful analysis of the code and its expected behavior.\n",
    "1. Techniques such as print statements, debugging tools, and code reviews can help identify and correct logical errors.\n",
