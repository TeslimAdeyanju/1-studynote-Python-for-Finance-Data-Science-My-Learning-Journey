    "`Instance Method`: Imagine you have a blueprint for a car, and you build a specific car from that blueprint. Now, if you want to do something with that specific car, like turn on its headlights or change its speed, you'd use an instance method. These methods are tied to a particular instance (or object) of a class, so they can access and modify the unique characteristics, or \"state,\" of that instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Class Method`: Going back to the car example, let's say you have a piece of information that applies to all cars built from the same blueprint, like the maximum speed limit for that model. A class method would be like a rule or operation that applies to all cars of that type. You'd use this method to access or modify characteristics that are shared among all instances of the class, rather than specific to one instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Static Method`: Now, imagine you have a tool in your garage that can be used for any car, regardless of its make or model. It doesn't need to know anything about specific cars; it just performs a task independently. This is similar to a static method, which is a standalone function inside a class that doesn't rely on any specific instance or class variables. It's like a utility function that can be used for general tasks within the class, but it doesn't have access to specific instance or class information."
