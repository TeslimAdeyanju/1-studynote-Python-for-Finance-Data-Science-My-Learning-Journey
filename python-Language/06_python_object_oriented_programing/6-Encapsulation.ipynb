    "Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit, e.g., a class in Java. This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation, or state, of an object from the outside. This is called information hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation in Python is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that helps manage complexity by bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. This concept also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is a way of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a plain English explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bundling Data and Methods: Imagine you have a capsule that contains medicine. The capsule itself represents a class in Python. Inside the capsule, you have the medicine (data) and instructions on how to take it (methods). When you create an object from the class, it's like taking the capsule with everything inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Protecting Data: Just like the capsule protects the medicine from being tampered with, encapsulation protects the data inside an object. You don’t access the medicine directly; you follow the instructions on the capsule. Similarly, in Python, you don’t directly access the data inside an object; you use methods provided by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Controlled Access: Encapsulation allows you to control how the data is accessed and modified. For instance, you might have a Car class with a private attribute _speed. You can’t directly change _speed, but you can use methods like set_speed(new_speed) and get_speed() to interact with it. These methods can include checks to ensure the new speed is within a valid range, thus protecting the integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Preventing Accidental Changes: By restricting direct access to the data, encapsulation prevents other parts of your code from accidentally changing it. This makes your code more reliable and easier to debug. For example, if the speed of a car could be set to a negative value by mistake, it could cause errors. Encapsulation helps prevent such mistakes by ensuring all changes go through the controlled methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, encapsulation is about creating a protective barrier around the data and the methods that operate on the data, ensuring they are used in a controlled and safe manner. This makes your code more modular, easier to maintain, and more secure."

    "Using encapsulation, we can hide an object’s internal representation from the outside. This is called information hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, encapsulation allows us to restrict accessing variables and methods directly and prevent accidental data modification by creating private data members and methods within a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a way to can restrict access to methods and variables from outside of class. Whenever we are working with the class and dealing with sensitive data, providing access to all variables used within the class is not a good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Suppose you have an attribute that is not visible from the outside of an object and bundle it with methods that provide read or write access. In that case, you can hide specific information and control access to the object’s internal state. Encapsulation offers a way for us to access the required variable without providing the program full-fledged access to all variables of a class. This mechanism is used to protect the data of an object from other objects.\n",

    "Explanation   \n",
    "1. Base Class (Person):   \n",
    "\n",
    "* Contains a protected attribute _name.   \n",
    "* Provides a method `get_details()` to return details of the person.   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Subclass (Employee):   \n",
    " \n",
    "* Inherits from Person.   \n",
    "* Adds a new attribute `employee_id`.   \n",
    "* Provides a method `get_employee_details(). that accesses the protected attribute `_name` from the base class.   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Instance Creation: \n",
    "\n",
    "* An instance of `Employee` is created with name, age, and employee ID. \n",
    "* Methods `get_details()` and `get_employee_details()` are called to access and print details. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Direct Access:\n",
    "* Although it's possible to access the protected attribute `_name` directly `(employee._name)`, it’s not recommended. Access should be done through methods provided by the class or subclass to maintain encapsulation and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points\n",
    "1. Protected Attributes: Indicated by a single underscore _ and meant to be accessed within the class and its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance: Protected attributes are useful in inheritance scenarios where a base class wants to share data with its subclasses without making it public.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Even though protected attributes can be accessed directly, it's better to use methods to ensure controlled access and modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach helps maintain a balance between data hiding and accessibility, especially in complex class hierarchies where certain data needs to be shared with derived classes but not exposed publicly."

    "#### Advantages of Encapsulation\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Security: The main advantage of using encapsulation is the security of the data. Encapsulation protects an object from unauthorized access. It allows private and protected access levels to prevent accidental data modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Hiding: The user would not be knowing what is going on behind the scene. They would only be knowing that to modify a data member, call the setter method. To read a data member, call the getter method. What these setter and getter methods are doing is hidden from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Simplicity: It simplifies the maintenance of the application by keeping classes separated and preventing them from tightly coupling with each other.\n",
